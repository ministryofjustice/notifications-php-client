#### personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or application date, you must provide their values in a dictionary with key value pairs. For example:

```php
$personalisation = [
    'name' => 'Amala',
    'application_date'  => '2018-01-01'
];
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

## Send a file by email

Send files without the need for email attachments.

This is an invitation-only feature. [Contact the GOV.UK Notify team](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support/ask-question-give-feedback) to enable this function for your service.

To send a file by email, add a placeholder field to the template and then upload a file. The placeholder field will contain a secure link to download the file.

The links are unique and unguessable. GOV.UK Notify cannot access or decrypt your file.

### Add a placeholder field to the template

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant email template.
1. Select __Edit__.
1. Add a placeholder field to the email template using double brackets. For example:

"Download your file at: ((link_to_file))"

### Upload your file

The file you upload must be a PDF, CSV, text file or Microsoft Word document smaller than 2MB.. [Contact the GOV.UK Notify team](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support/ask-question-give-feedback) if you need to send other file types.

Pass the file object as a value into the personalisation argument. For example:

```php
try {
    $file_data = file_get_contents('/path/to/my/file.pdf');

    $response = $notifyClient->sendEmail(
        'betty@example.com',
        'df10a23e-2c0d-4ea5-87fb-82e520cbf93c',
        [
            'name' => 'Betty Smith',
            'dob'  => '12 July 1968',
            'link_to_file' => $notifyClient->prepareUpload( $file_data )
        ]
    );

} catch (NotifyException $e){}
```

# Get message status

Message status depends on the type of message that you have sent.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

## Status - text and email

|Status|Information|
|:---|:---|
|Created|GOV.UK Notify has placed the message in a queue, ready to be sent to the provider. It should only remain in this state for a few seconds.|
|Sending|GOV.UK Notify has sent the message to the provider. The provider will try to deliver the message to the recipient. GOV.UK Notify is waiting for delivery information.|
|Delivered|The message was successfully delivered.|
|Failed|This covers all failure statuses:<br>- `permanent-failure` - "The provider could not deliver the message because the email address or phone number was wrong. You should remove these email addresses or phone numbers from your database. You’ll still be charged for text messages to numbers that do not exist."<br>- `temporary-failure` - "The provider could not deliver the message after trying for 72 hours. This can happen when the recipient's inbox is full or their phone is off. You can try to send the message again. You’ll still be charged for text messages to phones that are not accepting messages."<br>- `technical-failure` - "Your message was not sent because there was a problem between Notify and the provider.<br>You’ll have to try sending your messages again. You will not be charged for text messages that are affected by a technical failure."|

## Status - text only

|Status|Information|
|:---|:---|
|Pending|GOV.UK Notify is waiting for more delivery information.<br>GOV.UK Notify received a callback from the provider but the recipient's device has not yet responded. Another callback from the provider determines the final status of the notification.|
|Sent / Sent internationally|The message was sent to an international number. The mobile networks in some countries do not provide any more delivery information. The GOV.UK Notify client API returns this status as `sent`. The GOV.UK Notify client app returns this status as `Sent internationally`.|

## Status - letter

|Status|information|
|:---|:---|
|Failed|The only failure status that applies to letters is `technical-failure`. GOV.UK Notify had an unexpected error while sending to our printing provider.|
|Accepted|GOV.UK Notify has sent the letter to the provider to be printed.|
|Received|The provider has printed and dispatched the letter.|

## Status - precompiled letter

|Status|information|
|:---|:---|
|Pending virus check|GOV.UK Notify has not completed a virus scan of the precompiled letter file.|
|Virus scan failed|GOV.UK Notify found a potential virus in the precompiled letter file.|
|Validation failed|Content in the precompiled letter file is outside the printable area. See the [GOV.UK Notify PDF letter specification](https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation/images/notify-pdf-letter-spec-v2.3.pdf) for more information.|

## Get the status of one message

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

### Method

```php
getNotification( $notificationId )
```

For example:

```php
try {

    $response = $notifyClient->getNotification( 'c32e9c89-a423-42d2-85b7-a21cd4486a2a' );

} catch (NotifyException $e){}
```

### Arguments

#### notificationId (required)

The ID of the notification. You can find the notification ID in the response to the [original notification method call](#get-the-status-of-one-message-response).

You can also find it by [signing in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in) and going to the __API integration__ page.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns an `array`:

```php
[
    "id" => "notify_id",
    "body" => "Hello Foo",
    "subject" => "null|email_subject",
    "reference" => "client reference",
    "email_address" => "email address",
    "phone_number" => "phone number",
    "line_1" => "full name of a person or company",
    "line_2" => "123 The Street",
    "line_3" => "Some Area",

    "line_5" => "Some county",
    "line_6" => "Something else",
    "postcode" => "postcode",
    "postage" => "null|first|second",
    "type" => "sms|letter|email",
    "status" => "current status",
    "template" => [
        "version" => 1,
        "id" => 1,
        "uri" => "/template/{id}/{version}"
     ],
    "created_at" => "created at",
    "sent_at" => "sent to provider at",
];
```

### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client will return an `Alphagov\Notifications\Exception\NotifyException` object containing the relevant error code:

|exc->getCode()|exc->getErrors()|How to fix|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`400`|`[{`<br>`"error": "ValidationError",`<br>`"message": "id is not a valid UUID"`<br>`}]`|Check the notification ID.|
|`403`|`[{`<br>`"error": "AuthError",`<br>`"message": "Error: Your system clock must be accurate to within 30 seconds"`<br>`}]`|Check your system clock.|
|`403`|`[{`<br>`"error": "AuthError",`<br>`"message": "Invalid token: signature, api token not found"`<br>`}]`|Use the correct API key. Refer to [API keys](#api-keys) for more information.|
|`404`|`[{`<br>`"error": "NoResultFound",`<br>`"message": "No result found"`<br>`}]`|Check the notification ID.|


## Get the status of multiple messages

This API call returns one page of up to 250 messages and statuses. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

### Method

```php
listNotifications( array $filters = array() )
```

```php
    $response = $notifyClient->listNotifications([
        'older_than' => 'c32e9c89-a423-42d2-85b7-a21cd4486a2a',
        'reference' => 'weekly-reminders',
        'status' => 'delivered',
        'template_type' => 'sms'
    ]);
```

You can leave out the `older_than` argument to get the 250 most recent messages.

To get older messages, pass the ID of an older notification into the `older_than` argument. This returns the next 250 oldest messages from the specified notification ID.

### Arguments

older_than='740e5834-3a29-46b4-9a6f-16142fde533a'
```

If you leave out this argument, the method returns the most recent 250 notifications.

The client only returns notifications that are 7 days old or newer. If the notification specified in this argument is older than 7 days, the client returns an empty response.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns an `array`.
